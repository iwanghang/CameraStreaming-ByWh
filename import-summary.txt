ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea/
* .idea/CameraStreaming-master.iml
* .idea/libraries/
* .idea/libraries/logback_classic_0_9_26.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* CameraStreaming.iml
* README.md
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* doc/
* doc/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/commons-lang-2.6.jar => app/libs/commons-lang-2.6.jar
* libs/logback-classic-1.1.3.jar => app/libs/logback-classic-1.1.3.jar
* libs/logback-core-1.1.3.jar => app/libs/logback-core-1.1.3.jar
* libs/mina-core-2.0.2.jar => app/libs/mina-core-2.0.2.jar
* libs/org.springframework.core-3.0.5.RELEASE.jar => app/libs/org.springframework.core-3.0.5.RELEASE.jar
* libs/slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar => app/libs/slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/red5/io/flv/FLVMetaData.xsd => app/src/main/resources/org/red5/io/flv/FLVMetaData.xsd
* src/org/red5/io/flv/FLVMetaData_Template.xml => app/src/main/resources/org/red5/io/flv/FLVMetaData_Template.xml

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
